Archival repo of the Banderlabs app collection for Android. They are rather old, created around 2011, so may not work as developed under newer Android operating systems.

These apps require the user to use 'MENU' which is no longer a soft-key (I think Gingerbread was last major use, with possible KitKat usage). Even then, the two apps I tried, only one worked and that was with Notepad.
